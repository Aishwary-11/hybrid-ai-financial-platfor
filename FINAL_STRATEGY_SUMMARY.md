# üéØ **FINAL STRATEGY SUMMARY**
## From Technical Demo to $2M ARR Business

### **üìã Executive Summary**

We have successfully transformed from unrealistic claims about regulatory compliance and "real money" management to a viable business strategy focused on serving existing licensed financial institutions as a technology provider. The technical foundation is solid - success now depends entirely on customer development and business execution.
