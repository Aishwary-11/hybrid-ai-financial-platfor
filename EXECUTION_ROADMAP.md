## **üéØ CORE STRATEGY VALIDATION**

### **Why This Approach Will Work**

#### **1. Realistic Market Positioning** ‚úÖ
- **Technology enabler** vs. direct competitor to established players

- **Higher margins** than asset management (70%+ vs 30-40%)
- **Faster scaling** without regulatory capital requirements

#### **3. Technical Differentiation** ‚úÖ
- **Modern AI capabilities** that legacy vendors can't match quickly
- **Conversational interfaces** making complex analysis accessible
- **Real-time processing** vs batch-oriented legacy systems
- **Customization speed** advantage over enterprise software

#### **4. Market Timing** ‚úÖ
- **RIA growth** driving technology needs
- **Regulatory pressure** for better risk management
- **Fee compression** driving efficiency requirements

- [ ] **Identify 3-5 specific use cases** they'll pay for immediately
- [ ] **Map competitive landscape** and positioning opportunities

#### **Customer Interview Targets:**
```python
interview_targets = {
    'regional_rias': {
        'count': 25,
        'aum_range': '$200M-2B',
        'focus': 'operational efficiency, cost reduction'
    },

    'roi_demonstration': 'clear path to 3x return on investment'
}
```

### **3. Regulatory Strategy**

#### **Compliance Approach:**
