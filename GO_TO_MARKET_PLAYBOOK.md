## **üéØ CUSTOMER DEVELOPMENT EXECUTION**

### **What We'll Discover (Reality Check)**

#### **Expected Findings**
- **80% of our features aren't priorities** for customers
- **Real pain points are mundane operational issues** (not sexy AI features)
- **Buying decisions made by people who don't use the technology** (principals vs analysts)
- **Sales cycles are longer than expected** (6-18 months vs 3-6 months)
- **Price sensitivity varies widely** based on firm size and growth stage

#### **Common Customer Feedback Patterns**
```python
customer_feedback_patterns = {
    'feature_priorities': {
        'high_priority': ['Time savings', 'Compliance support', 'Client reporting'],
        'medium_priority': ['Performance analytics', 'Risk management', 'Integration'],
        'low_priority': ['AI insights', 'Advanced modeling', 'Predictive analytics']
    },
    'buying_concerns': {
        'top_concerns': ['Implementation time', 'Team training', 'Data migration'],
        'secondary_concerns': ['Cost justification', 'Vendor reliability', 'Support quality'],
        'minor_concerns': ['Feature completeness', 'Technology sophistication']
    }
}
```

### **Avoiding Common Pitfalls**

#### **Don't Do**
- **Build features before validating demand** (80% of features won't be used)
- **Compete on price** (you'll lose to established players with economies of scale)
- **Try to serve everyone** (focus on specific RIA segment and use cases)
- **Assume technical superiority equals market success** (customers buy outcomes, not features)
- **Rush the sales process** (relationship-driven industry requires trust building)

#### **Do Instead**
- **Charge premium prices for premium value** (position as high-end solution)
- **Focus on measurable business outcomes** (time savings, efficiency, ROI)
- **Build deep relationships with 5-10 clients first** (references are everything)
- **Let customer success drive feature development** (build what they actually use)
- **Invest heavily in customer success** (retention is easier than acquisition)
