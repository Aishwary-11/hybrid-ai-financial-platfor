# Hybrid AI Architecture - BlackRock Aladdin-Inspired System

## Introduction

This specification outlines the development of a sophisticated hybrid AI architecture for the Personal Aladdin investment management platform. The system combines state-of-the-art foundation models (GPT-4, Gemini) with specialized fine-tuned models trained on proprietary financial datasets, implementing BlackRock's systematic approach to AI-driven investment management.

The architecture emphasizes human-in-the-loop validation, robust guardrails, and specialized models that excel at specific financial tasks with significantly higher accuracy than general-purpose models.
